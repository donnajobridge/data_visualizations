*Project information:*
Experiment 1 from Remembering the forest or the trees (http://www.donnajobridge.com/tree.html)

*What is created:*
A confusion matrix is made for each emotion and test-face orientation combination (happy upright, happy inverted, sad upright, sad inverted).

Line plots are created to show Precision and Recall scores as a function of emotion (happy, sad) and test face orientation (upright, inverted).

A bar plot is also created with the same conditions showing the composite F1 score.

*How to run:*
To generate figures from behavioral data, go to terminal in the emo directory. From there, run `python run_emo.py`
